	jShell

	My CLI is called jShell. It works but prompting the user for input untill exit it entered.
	jShell will take in commands and execute them. If an error occurs the error will be printed to stderr
	and the jShell will continue.

	System()
	
	The system function executes commands using the os shell. It handles
	arguments and process managment in this way. Which is differnt to execvp().
	
	execvp()
	
	This funtion takes in a file name along with an array of arguments and replaces the current current
	running process with the new process being executed with the file and arguments.
	This function does not utilise the os shell and is much more powerful.
	
	cd
	
	cd is an internal shell command and cannot be called by exevp(). To change the current directory
	a shell will need to use the chdir() function. This will change the current directory of the current
	process and any child processes created after that. This will not effect the parent procces.
